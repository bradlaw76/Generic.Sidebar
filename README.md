üöÄ Generic Sidebar for Dynamics 365 ‚Äî Release v1.0.5
The Generic Sidebar kit provides a flexible, table-driven side pane for Dynamics 365 Customer Service and other model-driven apps.
Instead of writing custom HTML/JS each time, you configure a single Dataverse table row to control instructions, embeds, icons, and theming.

‚ú® What‚Äôs New in v1.0.5


‚úÖ Admin Acknowledgement Banner
Added a demo disclaimer banner visible only to admins.

Includes a ‚ÄúAcknowledge‚Äù button that flips sidebar_acknowledged = Yes in the default row.
Ensures clear consent before use in production.



‚úÖ PowerApps Canvas App support
The sidebar_embedcode field now accepts Canvas App embed code alongside Copilot, URLs, HTML snippets, and web resources.


‚úÖ Improved Copilot Embeds

Full-height rendering ensured.
Optional theming applied via sidebar_primarycolor, sidebar_textcolor, sidebar_linkcolor.



‚úÖ Flow Template (Docs)
Release notes & docs now include a recommended Power Automate Flow to enforce a single default row at any time.



üõ† Key Features

Table-driven config (sidebar_genericsidebar) ‚Äî no redeployments required.
Rich instructions band with bullet/heading normalization.
Embed options:

Copilot Studio Bot
External Websites

‚ö° Quick Setup

Import the solution into your Dynamics 365 environment.
Create at least one row in sidebar_genericsidebar with sidebar_default = Yes.
Populate:

sidebar_title (header title)
sidebar_instructions (rich text instructions)
sidebar_embedcode (Copilot iframe, URL, webresource, Canvas App, or raw HTML)


Add the JS web resource to your form ‚Üí OnLoad handler:

üìã Known Limitations

External sites may block embedding (X-Frame-Options / CSP).
sidebar_acknowledged is optional; banner skipped if missing.
No telemetry; use GitHub Release downloads for adoption tracking.


‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This kit is provided as-is. It is intended primarily for demo / proof-of-concept purposes.
Before production use, admins must acknowledge the disclaimer via the welcome banner (sets sidebar_acknowledged = Yes).
Do you want me to also generate a shorter version of this (like a TL;DR) that‚Äôs optimized for the GitHub Releases description box, while keeping this full version inside the repo as CHANGELOG.md?
